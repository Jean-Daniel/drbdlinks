.SH NAME
drbdlinks \- manages links into a shared DRBD partition
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drbdlinks
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [start|stop|auto|status|monitor|checklinks]
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B drbdlinks
is a program which manages links into a DRBD partition which is shared
among several machines.  It is meant to be used in conjunction with the
heartbeat system for simplifying management of high availability clusters.
A simple configuration file, "/etc/drbdlinks.conf", specifies the links.
This can be used to manage links for "/etc/apache", "/var/lib/pgsql",
and other system files and directories that need to appear as if they
are local to the system when running applications after a DRBD shared
partition has been mounted.

A sample configuration file with annotations is included in the drbdlinks
distribution.

When run with "start" as the mode, drbdlinks will rename the existing
files/directories, and then make symbolic links into the DRBD
partition.  "stop" does the reverse.

Mode "checklinks" will report any links that do not exist in the
destination area.  During initial setup and configuration, this can help
check that you have the destination file-system set up with the required
components.

If run with "initialize_shared_storage", destination links specified in the
configuration file will be populated from the source storage.  This is
useful for initial setup to populate the shared storage.  Preceding paths
will be populated if they share the same name from source to destination.

The "monitor" and "status" modes will check the file-system against the
configuration file and will report "running" (monitor mode) or "OK" (status
mode) if all links appear to be up.  Otherwise they report "down" or
"stopped" (respectively).

By default, the rename appends .drbdlinks to the name, but this can be
overridden in the configuration file.

The "list" mode just show the list of links, with each line showing the
link, destination, and a 0/1 flag for bindMount status.  This may be useful
for user scripts without having to parse the configuration.

An init script is included which runs "stop" before heartbeat starts,
and after heartbeat stops.  This is done to try to ensure that when
the shared partition isn't mounted, the links are in their normal
state.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B drbdlinks
has several options, using either short or long variants.
.PP
.IP "\fB-h, --help\fP"
Print a short help message describing the available options and exit.

.IP "\fB-c, --config-file=CONFIGFILE\fP"
Specify an alternate config file.  The default config file is
/etc/drbdlinks.conf.  Alternate config files should have a "drbdlinks-"
prefix, e.g. "drbdlinks-httpd.conf".

.IP "\fB-s, --suffix=SUFFIX\fP"
Name to append to the local file-system name when the link is in place.  The
default is "drbdlinks", which would result in a renamed file like
"/etc/httpd.drbdlinks".

.IP "\fB-v, --verbose\fP"
Increase verbosity level by 1 for every occurrence of this option.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Here are a few examples of how drbdlinks can be used.

The most straight-forward, and default, method for starting drbdlinks:
.PP
.RS
drbdlinks start
.RE

To use a suffix different from the default when linking to a file or
directory, the -s option can be used, specifying the desired string:
.PP
.RS
drbdlinks -s orig start
.RE

would rename the file-system name to "name.orig".

Increase the verbosity to assist in debugging:
.PP
.RS
drbdlinks -v -v start
.RE

Use an alternate configuration file, possibly from with a DRBD mounted
file-system:
.PP
.RS
drbdlinks -c /shared1/drbdlinks-httpd.conf start
.RE

This would use the specified configuration file, found on our DRBD device
mounted on /shared1.  This would allow us to easily keep drbdlinks
configurations tied to a specific set of data on a DRBD disk in an
active/active sort of HA configuration.
